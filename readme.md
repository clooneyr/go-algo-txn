# Submit a signed Algorand transaction to a Go backend using Gin example.

- The above code gives a good example of how you would send a sign transaction for handling to your Go backend. The key parts of this code are on line 53 of the Tester.js file where we have move the data from our signed transaction into a new array.  

- The Go part just uses Gin to handle the POST request and binds the JSON data to a struct.
